the best way to have 2 buttons is that 
i could bacically first go into my html document and take them in the
 div and give that particular div an id , after this when i go into my css document then i can take it go to the no. 
of line =(line 24 in pink.css ) after this to give them a 
little breathing space i would do it like =(line 30 in pink.css)this says that
 if there is any div then give it the following commands that you ENTER.


 function rpsGame (yourChoice) {
  //console.log(yourChoice);
  var humanChoice , botChoice;
  humanChoice = yourChoice;
  botChoice= Math.floor(Math.random()*3);
  if( humanChoice = botChoice) {
  var nice = 'you made it to a tie';
  } else if (humanChoice > botChoice) {
       nice = 'you WON!!!';
  }else{
    nice = 'you lose buddy, I MADE IT!!';
  }
  console.log(nice);
}
